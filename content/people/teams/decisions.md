# Teams Problems. Decision Making

## Basics

### Decision Levels

* **Operational**
  Everyday decisions, often made quickly with little structure.
  *Example*: Assigning today’s coding task or approving a pull request.

* **Tactical**
  Medium-term decisions that support strategy and direct resources.
  *Example*: Choosing a testing framework for the project.

* **Strategic**
  Long-term decisions about direction, goals, values.
  *Example*: Deciding to adopt Agile development across the organization.

---

### Major Problem – **Analysis Paralysis**

When teams spend too much time analyzing options, they fail to act.

* **Buridan’s Ass** – A paradox where too many choices prevent decision.
* **Focus on drawbacks** – Overemphasis on risks stalls progress.
* **Result** – Delay, lost opportunities, wasted energy.

---

### Basic Techniques

* **T-Chart (+/–)**: Compare pros and cons.
* **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
* **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)**: Focus on the small % of causes that yield big results.
* **Pair-Wise Comparison**: Compare options against each other, one by one.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare expected gains vs. expected costs.

### Decision Making Model

(*Source: Hoover et al, Evaluating Project Decisions*)

**Inputs**

* Problem (requirements, constraints)
* Assumptions
* Knowledge (facts, data)
* Experience (skills, intuition)

**Decision Process**

* Select and apply a decision technique (e.g., SWOT, cost-benefit).

**Outputs**

* Solution chosen
* Assumed risks documented

## Influencing Factors

### Decision-Driven Organizations

(*Source: Rogers & Blenko*)

* Some decisions matter more than others → focus on high-impact ones.
* Action is the goal (Standish Report).
* Ambiguity is the enemy → clarify.
* Speed & adaptability are crucial.
* Roles > org chart → empower decision-owners.
* Fear of overstepping must be overcome.
* Well-aligned organizations reinforce roles.
* Practice builds capability: “practicing beats preaching.”

**Core problem**: *How much information is “enough” before deciding?*

---

### Intuitive Decision Making

(\*Source: Gary Klein, *The Power of Intuition*)

* **Definition**: Translating experience into action, often without formal analysis.
* **Origins**: Firefighters, military, police — high-pressure environments.
* **Premise**: Intuition is a skill → can be built, applied, safeguarded.

**Advantages**

* Very fast, based on pattern recognition.
* Allows action under uncertainty and time pressure.

**Risks**

* Over-reliance on familiar patterns → blind spots.
* Experienced people can still make fatal mistakes (“Deep Survival” – Gonzales).
* Low risk ≠ no risk.

**Barriers**

* Rigid policies, remote/distributed teams, turnover, constant change.
* Procedures, metrics-driven culture, IT constraints.

### Theory of Thin Slicing

(\*Source: Malcolm Gladwell, *Blink*)

**Definition**:
Ability to make accurate judgments based on very small “slices” of information.

**Examples**:

* **John Gottman’s Love Lab** → Predicting relationship success by coding emotional signals (SPAFF).
* **Military interceptors** → Interpreting Morse code patterns.
* **Medical research** (Levinson, Ambadi) → Malpractice risk depends on *tone* and *empathy*, not just content.

**Key Point**: Thin slicing is part of human cognition, not a rare talent.

---

### Time and Decision Making

(*Source: Gary Klein*)

**Chess Experiment**

* Blitz vs. regular → skilled players made similar % of good moves.

**Observations**

* Skilled decision makers can make good choices even under pressure.
* Often their *first considered action* is already a good one.

---

### Group Decision Making

(*Source: Marlene K. Rebori*)

**Common outcomes in groups**:

* No decision (paralysis)
* Self-appointed decision maker
* Minority rule
* Majority rule
* Consensus

**How to choose method?**

* Based on timeliness, appropriateness, relationships.

**Problems in group decisions**

* Deciding too soon (rushing).
* Analysis paralysis (stalling).
* No clear criteria.
* Poor listening → debate instead of dialogue.
* Perceptions of unfairness.
* Groupthink / *Abilene Paradox* (agreement without real support).

### 4. *The Power of Intuition* / *Sources of Power* by Gary Klein

* While your note references *The Power of Intuition* and intuitive decision making in high-pressure environments (firefighters, etc.), the actual research seems to originate from Klein’s earlier book **Sources of Power** (MIT Press, 1998), especially Chapter 4 ([fop86.com][7]).

* Covers *thin slicing*, snap judgments, the Getty kouros example, etc.
* Additional supporting review and article available from *Wired* (2005) ([WIRED][9]).

### 6. Research on *Thin Slicing* (Psychology Studies)

* **Thin-slicing** concept originated in research by **Nalini Ambady** and **Robert Rosenthal** (e.g. teacher evaluations from brief silent video clips) ([Wikipedia][10]).
* Gladwell referenced their findings in *Blink*.
