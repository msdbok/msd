# Teams Problems: Decision Making

## Basics

### Decision Levels

- **Operational:**  
  Everyday decisions, often made quickly with little structure.  
  *Example:* Assigning today’s coding task or approving a pull request.

- **Tactical:**  
  Medium-term decisions that support strategy and direct resources.  
  *Example:* Choosing a testing framework for the project.

- **Strategic:**  
  Long-term decisions about direction, goals, values.  
  *Example:* Deciding to adopt Agile development across the organization.

### Major Problem – Analysis Paralysis

When teams spend too much time analyzing options, they fail to act.

- **Buridan’s Ass:** A paradox where too many choices prevent decision.
- **Focus on drawbacks:** Overemphasis on risks stalls progress.
- **Result:** Delay, lost opportunities, wasted energy.

---

### Basic Techniques

- **T-Chart (+/–):** Compare pros and cons.
- **SWOT Analysis:** Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
- **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule):** Focus on the small % of causes that yield big results.
- **Pair-Wise Comparison:** Compare options against each other, one by one.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Compare expected gains vs. expected costs.

### Decision Making Model

(*Source: Hoover et al, Evaluating Project Decisions*)

**Inputs**
- Problem (requirements, constraints)
- Assumptions
- Knowledge (facts, data)
- Experience (skills, intuition)

**Decision Process**
- Select and apply a decision technique (e.g., SWOT, cost-benefit).

**Outputs**
- Solution chosen
- Assumed risks documented

## Influencing Factors

### Decision-Driven Organizations

(*Source: Rogers & Blenko*)

- Some decisions matter more than others → focus on high-impact ones.
- Action is the goal (Standish Report).
- Ambiguity is the enemy → clarify.
- Speed & adaptability are crucial.
- Roles > org chart → empower decision-owners.
- Fear of overstepping must be overcome.
- Well-aligned organizations reinforce roles.
- Practice builds capability: “practicing beats preaching.”

**Core problem:**  
How much information is “enough” before deciding?

### Intuitive Decision Making

(*Source: Gary Klein, The Power of Intuition*)

- **Definition:** Translating experience into action, often without formal analysis.
- **Origins:** Firefighters, military, police — high-pressure environments.
- **Premise:** Intuition is a skill → can be built, applied, safeguarded.

**Advantages**
- Very fast, based on pattern recognition.
- Allows action under uncertainty and time pressure.

**Risks**
- Over-reliance on familiar patterns → blind spots.
- Experienced people can still make fatal mistakes (“Deep Survival” – Gonzales).
- Low risk ≠ no risk.

**Barriers**
- Rigid policies, remote/distributed teams, turnover, constant change.
- Procedures, metrics-driven culture, IT constraints.

### Theory of Thin Slicing

(*Source: Malcolm Gladwell, Blink*)

- **Definition:** Ability to make accurate judgments based on very small “slices” of information.

**Examples**
- **John Gottman’s Love Lab:** Predicting relationship success by coding emotional signals (SPAFF).
- **Military interceptors:** Interpreting Morse code patterns.
- **Medical research (Levinson, Ambadi):** Malpractice risk depends on *tone* and *empathy*, not just content.

**Key Point:**  
Thin slicing is part of human cognition, not a rare talent.

### Time and Decision Making

(*Source: Gary Klein*)

**Chess Experiment**
- Blitz vs. regular → skilled players made similar % of good moves.

**Observations**
- Skilled decision makers can make good choices even under pressure.
- Often their *first considered action* is already a good one.

---

### Group Decision Making

(*Source: Marlene K. Rebori*)

**Common outcomes in groups:**
- No decision (paralysis)
- Self-appointed decision maker
- Minority rule
- Majority rule
- Consensus

**How to choose method?**
- Based on timeliness, appropriateness, relationships.

**Problems in group decisions**
- Deciding too soon (rushing).
- Analysis paralysis (stalling).
- No clear criteria.
- Poor listening → debate instead of dialogue.
- Perceptions of unfairness.
- Groupthink / *Abilene Paradox* (agreement without real support).
