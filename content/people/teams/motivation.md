# Teams Problems & Motivation

## The Classic Team Story

A very common scenario in teams:

> "This is the story of four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody.  
> There was an important job to be done and Everybody was asked to do it.  
> Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that because it was Everybody's job.  
> Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it.  
> Consequently, it wound up that Nobody told Anybody, so Everybody blamed Somebody."

This story illustrates how unclear roles and responsibilities can lead to confusion, frustration, and poor team performance.

## Social Loafing & The Freerider Problem

**Social Loafing** (Source: Greenberg, 1996, *Managing Behaviors in Organizations*)  
People in groups or teams often don’t work as hard as they do when working alone.  
While team performance increases with team size, the rate of increase slows down—sometimes individual effort drops.

### What is the Freerider Problem?

- **Free riders** are team members who contribute less, relying on others to carry the workload.

#### Causes of Social Loafing

- **Diffusion of responsibility:**  
  It’s difficult to distinguish individual contributions, so people feel less accountable.
- **Lack of recognition:**  
  People don’t feel their efforts will be noticed or rewarded.
- **Dispensability of effort:**  
  Members may feel their work isn’t essential or impactful.
- **Sucker aversion:**  
  Fear of being taken advantage of—doing all the work and getting little credit.
