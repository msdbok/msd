- May equate self-expression with communication, but not always recognize miscommunication
- Can be blunt or direct; value intelligence and quick thinking
- Sometimes struggle to distinguish facts, inferences, and assumptions
- Loyalty often to job type or immediate manager, not company
- Distrust of authority and rigid rules
- May not always understand the business domain, leading to gaps in communication

---

## Groups & Authority

- Seek peer recognition and acceptance
- Competitive, which can challenge teamwork
- Prefer working alone but recognize group dynamics
- Often ignore rules, dress codes, and standards unless respected
- Value domain expertise over formal authority
- Rebels in spirit; value autonomy and personal space
- Defacto leaders may emerge based on expertise, not title

## Motivation & De-motivators

**What motivates technical people?**
- Inclusion in decision making
- Clear understanding of the big picture and project goals
- Consistent rewards and recognition
- Responsibility matched to control
- Effective use of technical skills
- Positive work environment and perks (e.g., flexible hours, free food)
- Opportunities for growth and learning

**De-motivators:**
- Exclusion from decisions
- Lack of transparency or hiding the big picture
- Inconsistent rewards/punishments
- Favoritism ("pet" focus on individuals)
- Responsibility without authority or control
- Poor use of extrinsic motivators (e.g., meaningless bonuses)
- Micromanagement
- Focus on tasks and "how" instead of results
- Evaluations without clear criteria
- Assigning blame for issues outside their control

*Examples of poor extrinsic motivators:*  
Giving gift cards for attendance, but not for innovation or problem-solving.  
Rewarding only those who work overtime, rather than those who deliver quality solutions.

- Mentor, don’t boss—guide and support rather than control
- Manage by goals, not quotas—focus on outcomes, not just numbers
- Recognize and use technical competency—let experts lead in their domain
- Accentuate the positive—be honest, not superficial
- Foster a supportive physical and social environment—address annoyances and create space for focused work
- Promote healthy interdependencies—encourage collaboration where appropriate

## Common Obstacles

- **Conflict resolution:**  
  Most issues stem from a few sources (80/20 rule). Address root causes, not just symptoms.
- **Annoying tasks:**  
  HR paperwork, parking, and other non-technical hassles can demotivate teams.
- **Culture building:**  
  Promote honesty, fairness, and a helping team spirit. Encourage open feedback and learning from mistakes.
- **Communication flows:**  
  Facilitate open communication—avoid secrecy and silos. Make information accessible.
- **Trust and ambiguity:**  
  Build trust through transparency and consistency. Help teams manage uncertainty and change.
- **Patience and intervention:**  
  Know when to step in and when to let teams solve problems independently. Practice patience and support.
