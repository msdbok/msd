### Objective  

These course notes aim to:  
- Offer a structured and accessible overview of Managing Software Development topics.  
- Bridge the gap between theory and real-world practice, equipping readers with actionable insights.  
- Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the software development community.

**Approach:**  
- Focus on breadth over depth, introducing a wide range of concepts and practices.
- Present current and leading industry techniques, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
- Emphasize understanding the differences between approaches, rather than immediate mastery.
- Encourage critical thinking:  
    - Reason about which techniques to apply in different contexts  
    - Justify your choices with clear arguments  
    - Explicitly state your assumptions, based on available facts

Our goal is to help you build a foundation for making informed decisions in software development management.
